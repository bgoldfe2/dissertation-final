# Performance analysis of transformer-based architectures and their ensembles to detect trait-based cyberbullying


## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN



### Getting started


- Install PyTorch and other dependencies.

  please run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Training and Evaluation
- Go to the `Scripts` directory:
```bash
cd Scripts
```

- Train stand-alone model (BERT-base-uncased) with GPU support:
```bash
python train.py
```
- Train stand-alone model (BERT-base-uncased) with CPU only:
```bash
python train.py --device CPU
```
- Train stand-alone model with Twitter-parsed dataset:
```bash
python train.py --dataset Twitter
```
Information regarding other training parameters can be found at `Scripts/common.py` file.

Fine-tuned models will be saved at `../Models/` folder.\
Evaluation output files will be saved at `../Output/` folder.\
Figures will be saved at `../Figures/` folder.
